# MetabolomicsClassifier

## python environment：
numpy         1.24.4

pandas        2.0.3

scikit-learn  1.0.2

xgboost       1.7.6

python        3.8

## Running methods：
Running `python ClassificationTest.py` will give you a Result folder with the same name as missingData. Where 'O' is complete data, 'MCAR' is completely random deletion, and 'MNAR' is non-random deletion.

### Tips：
If you want to run your file, change the file_name in ClassificationTest.py to your file. Please note that the format of the file, the behavior metabolite, is listed as a sample, and the name of the metabolite cannot be repeated.
